<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p>My name is <strong>Humberto Franyie</strong>, and I’m a <strong>Computer Engineer</strong> with over 7 years of experience in the technology industry. I currently work as a <strong>Technical Account Manager at AWS</strong>, supporting enterprise customers in Latin America on their journey to adopt cloud technologies and Artificial Intelligence.</p>

<p>I hold two master’s degrees: one in <strong>Business Administration (MBA)</strong> and another in <strong>Engineering</strong>, which helps me bridge technical solutions with real business outcomes.</p>

<p>I created this course because after working with customers across different industries, I realized that many professionals—from engineers to project managers—want to explore the world of Artificial Intelligence but often feel it’s too complex or reserved for math experts.  
The truth is, <strong>anyone with curiosity and a desire to learn can master Machine Learning on AWS</strong>, and I want to help you do just that.</p>

<p>This module on Generative AI is especially relevant because we are living through a major technological shift—and I want you to be prepared to make the most of it.  
If I, with a mixed background in tech and business, was able to specialize in this field, I’m confident you can too. Let’s go on this journey together!</p>

<blockquote><em>"Generative AI is like imagination: it has no limits if you know how to use it. What seems like magic today will be a basic skill tomorrow. Get ready for that future."</em></blockquote>
