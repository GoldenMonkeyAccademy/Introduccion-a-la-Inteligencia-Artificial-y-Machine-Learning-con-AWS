<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p>My name is <strong>Humberto Franyie</strong>, and I am a <strong>Computer Engineer</strong> with over 20 years of experience in technology, consulting, and digital transformation. I currently work as a <strong>Solutions Architect and Machine Learning Consultant at AWS</strong>, supporting leading companies in Latin America in their adoption of Artificial Intelligence and cloud services.</p>

<p>I hold two master's degrees: one in <strong>Business Administration (MBA)</strong> and another in <strong>Engineering</strong>, which allows me to bridge the gap between the technical world and real business impact.</p>

<p>I created this course because, after years of working with clients, I noticed that many professionals—from engineers to project managers—want to get into the world of Artificial Intelligence but feel it’s too complex or reserved for math experts.  
The truth is that <strong>anyone with curiosity and a desire to learn can master Machine Learning on AWS</strong>, and I want to help you get there.</p>

<p>This module on Generative AI is especially relevant because we are living through a technological revolution, and I want you to be fully prepared to take advantage of it.  
If I, coming from a hybrid background in tech and business, was able to specialize in this field, I’m confident that you can too. Let’s do this together!</p>

<blockquote><em>"Generative AI is like imagination: it has no limits if you know how to use it. What seems like magic today will be a basic skill tomorrow. Get ready for that future."</em></blockquote>
