<h1>Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning with AWS</h1>

<p>Discover how Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning work, and learn how to apply them using AWS services. This is a practical, clear, and beginner-friendly courseâ€”ideal for understanding AI and taking your first steps in real-world projects.</p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence is much more than a tech trendâ€”it's a powerful tool that's transforming industries, business models, and the way we make decisions. However, for many professionals, AI and Machine Learning (ML) still sound like complicated concepts reserved for data scientists or advanced math experts.</p>

<p>This course is designed to break down those barriers and bring you into the real world of AI in a practical and accessible way, using AWSâ€”the leading cloud platformâ€”as our foundation. Through real examples, simple explanations, and guided exercises, you'll learn how to leverage AI to solve problems, automate processes, and make smarter decisions.</p>

<p>And if you're looking to formalize your knowledge, this course is also a great first step toward certifications like the AWS Certified Machine Learning â€“ Specialty (MLS-C01). But thatâ€™s not the only goalâ€”the main purpose is to help you understand how AI works and how you can apply it in your daily work.</p>
